Freedom is, was and will always remain important. This applies to our
physical world as well as our digital world. To maintain our freedom we
need protection and good IT security. Good security brings freedom the way you want and enables you to exchange information without censorship or monitoring. Your secret information and your communication belongs to you. So take measurements to make is yours again.

Privacy needs solid security to start with, but if you value your own freedom, you should respect your customers freedom too. So make sure your users can trust you. So respect their privacy by using tangible privacy measurements by design principles when creating new solutions.

Good security and privacy do not have to be endlessly expensive. It all 
starts with good architecture and a solid design. This reference
architecture gives you a head start for creating your specific security
and privacy designs. You can use the proposed security and privacy
principles and the sample requirements to start with. Furthermore you can use or start with
security models we present in this reference architecture  as well. Also
a list of example security system building blocks is presented. Since
open source solutions can be valuable to lower security risks and reduce
cost in your organization all presented solutions in this reference
architecture are open source. This book also presents a list of criteria
to evaluate the quality of OSS security and privacy solutions is.

Good privacy and security is difficult and complex. Making use of
information presented in this book assures you do not have to reinvent
the wheel so to say. Good security and privacy design for information
systems is important. So do not lose your valuable time on trivial
aspects. You need your time to solve the security and privacy challenges for your unique situation!

Good protection for our privacy is getting more and more difficult and
expensive. In our opinion freedom requires very strong privacy
protection assurances. We do not live a world where cyber security
is always at a normal (low) risk level. You need more protection measurements by default to protect
your core information assets like personal and business information and your valuable privacy data records. We still have a long way to go. But using solutions provided in this reference architecture lowers your security and privacy risks.

For privacy and security we need strong governance institutes that set
rules to keep our (online) freedom.

If you want to help to remain freedom and want a more secure world,
consider to support e.g. The Electronic Frontier Foundation
(https://www.eff.org ), a non-profit organization defending civil
liberties in the digital world. Or support a similar local non-profit
organization in your country.
