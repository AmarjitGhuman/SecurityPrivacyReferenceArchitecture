Hacking Reference Models
=========================

This directs you to reference models for advanced hacking. 


Car Hacking
------------

Cars and especially autonomous cars are trending. Cars are nowadays also almost computers on wheels. In order to make sure it's safe, secure and vendors do not mess with your privacy hacking cars should not be a crime but should be encouraged. Since most advanced cars are build upon OSS software security and privacy has increased significantly. 

To know how secure cars are, use:

The Car Hackers Handbook: http://opengarages.org/handbook/ 
This Car Hackers Handbook will help you create better threat models for vehicles. Also your knowledge on how cars work will increase per page.

 
Robot Hacking
------------------

Robots are more and more used on various places. E.g. robots are used in homes, in assembly lines in industry and are deployed in medical facilities. But robot security is still underestimated. 

The Robot Security Framework (RSF)is a standardized methodology to perform security assessments in robotics. 
The model is GPLv3 licensed and can be found here: https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RSF
