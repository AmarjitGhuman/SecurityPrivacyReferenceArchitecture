| Name Principle   | Defensive data collection                                                                                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Statement**    | Limited data collected from users only for functionality needed.                                                         |
| **Rationale**    | Only collect data what is needed for performing functionality. Limiting data collection prevents risks on data leakage.  |
| **Implications** | De-identify where and when possible to reduce risk of privacy data concerns. Data must deleted when no longer necessary. |

| Name Principle   | Design reviews                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Statement**    | All architectures and designs must be reviewed. Minimal on security aspects and potential risks. Also to determine if all (security and privacy) principles and requirements are followed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Rationale**    | Integrating security into the design phase saves money and time. Conduct a risk review with security professionals and threat model the application to identify key risks and to improve product and processes under development. This helps you integrate appropriate countermeasures into the design and architecture of the application. Improving architecture and design is by far the best option (time,cost etc) for dealing with security and privacy. |
| **Implications** | Organize or make use of a structured review process to benefit from review. SME (Subject Matter Experts) must be available for doing reviews. Reserve time to improve architectures and designs or to improve code.

| Name Principle   | Don't trust infrastructure                                                                                                                                                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Statement**    | Underlaying infrastructure cannot be assumed safe.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Rationale**    | Vulnerabilities are at hardware,firmwire, virtualization, middleware and application layers. To minimize data leakage risks trusting security of other objects should be prevented. |
| **Implications** | Sandbox model /Jericho model needed. Layered defense easily possible                                                                                                                |

| Name Principle   | Don't trust services (from others)                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Statement**    | Services from others (departments, companies) should never (ever) be trusted.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Rationale**    | Security design should protect against services use of other layers or applications (also SAAS services). Systems or sub-systems outside the bounds of a receiving component must never be trusted implicitly.                          |
| **Implications** | Every input/output and given by external services must be validated. Authentication, authorization can be needed. Measurements to maintain availability when using services (input or output) requires strict measurements implemented. |
