OSS Security and Privacy SBB Selection
----------------------------------------


When you are aware of the advantages and disadvantages of using open source
building blocks for your security architecture or design, this reference architecture provides an up-to-date overview of really great open source security solutions. 

A known difficult taks is to select (or create) solution building blocks that covers the needed functionality. Of course you should always start with principles, requirements and constraints first. And remember: No single tool will fit all use cases. So select the right tool for the right job.

To give some guidance on selecting products to lower risks on security and privacy a conceptual model can be usefull. The key of a usefull conceptual model is that a seperation is made between the needs (requirements) and the solution ('the how') is clear.

Architecture view of Security Applications
---------------------------------------------

The number of OSS security applications available is over
overwhelming. Using the following conceptual topology can help with
arranging functional to product mapping needs:

For every security or privacy function or service needed you should look
serious at using open transparent reusable solutions. So Open Source. Of
course many vendors provide good solid security products for specific
use cases. But when you feel you need a trivial security or privacy
service, there is almost always a working and maintained OSS application
available. When using OSS solutions, you have have a large choice
of companies that deliver maintenance and support on this application on
commercial bases.Â 

Architecture view of Privacy Applications
--------------------------------------------

Besides strong security measurements strong encryption is hard to accomplish. Especially online and when you do not use FOSS software in combination with open hardware that you can really trust! However due to the growing importance privacy the number of FOSS tools available is increasing. An framework for putting privacy Architecture Building Blocks on a map:

Using this privacy ABBs you can select OSS Solution Building Blocks that match your requirements. And remember: No single (OSS or commercial) is perfect. A tool alone will never be enough. So make sure you have a good balance between tool support and a good privacy and/or security organization to manage risks.
