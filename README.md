Contributing
============

We encourage all security professionals to improve this reference architecture. Join the team to:

-   Add security or privacy principles.
-   Add security or privacy models.
-   Help us create the largest OSS reference framework on OSS security and privacy applications and tools.
-   Create better graphics and text.
-   Add threat models that can be easily reused.
-   Improve criteria on selecting OSS solutions for security and privacy applications.
-   Create tools to speed up the process of making use of this reference architecture. E.g. we created a GPL WordPress tool to manage and create security specification documents fast. Help us to improve these tools or create your own.

If you contribute you will of course get credit (mentioned in upcoming publications).
