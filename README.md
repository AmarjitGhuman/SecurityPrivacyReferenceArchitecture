#Open Reference Architecture for Security and Privacy

This reference architecture is created to improve security and privacy designs in general. In our opinion it is time to stop reinventing the wheel when it comes down to creating architectures and designs for security and privacy solutions. The reference architecture is not just another security book. This book is all about reuse.

Using this book gives creating your security solution a head start!

This reference architecture saves time in many ways:

* You can create a solution architecture based on it for your specific situation.
* It enables you to speed up the process of creating a specific solution.
* It contains valuable content and general background information which can be used, reused or referred to.


Information security architecture is an abstraction of a design that identifies and describes where and how security controls are used. It also identifies and describes the location and sensitivity of both user and application data. This open reference security architecture aims to help you create your context specific architecture faster and with higher quality.

This reference architecture is designed to assist and guide architects, security designers and developers to make better decisions and to reuse quality architecture knowledge regarding cyber security aspects.

**Features**

* Reusable list of security principles
* Reusable list of privacy principles
* Collection of common attack vectors and thread models
* In-depth list to determining the quality of OSS for security and privacy applications
* List of great OSS security and privacy applications

You can download the book in various formats:

*  [ePUB] (http://bm-support.org/pdfdocs/ReferenceArchitectureForSecurityandPrivacy.epub)
*  [PDF] (http://bm-support.org/pdfdocs/ReferenceArchitectureForSecurityandPrivacy.pdf)

Don’t forget to send us your email (or follow us on twitter) if you want to keep noticed on updates.

If you need help with creating a security solution design for your project, don’t hesitate to contact us! Although creating a security design is easier and faster using this Open Reference Architecture, our security consultants are trained experts in driving your project to the next level and minimizing security and privacy concerns.

We encourage all security professionals to improve this reference architecture. Your contributions to this Guide are greatly appreciated.

Contributing
============

We encourage all security professionals to improve this reference architecture. Join the team to:

-   Add security or privacy principles.
-   Add security or privacy models.
-   Help us create the largest OSS reference framework on OSS security and privacy applications and tools.
-   Create better graphics and text.
-   Add threat models that can be easily reused.
-   Improve criteria on selecting OSS solutions for security and privacy applications.
-   Create tools to speed up the process of making use of this reference architecture. E.g. we created a GPL WordPress tool to manage and create security specification documents fast. Help us to improve these tools or create your own. 

Your contributions to this Guide are greatly appreciated as long as contributions fit within the scope and goal of this security and privacy reference architecture. As an open project, this Open Reference Architecture for Security and Privacy shall always remain vendor-neutral and freely available for all to use. If you contribute you will of course get credit (mentioned in upcoming publications). 

You can contribute using the following Github repository:\[create link to main opensec project on github\]

Please observe our contribution guidelines before creating a pull request:

With the exception of typos and spelling mistakes (feel free to fix these and they'll be merged), please observe the following guides:

-   Always open an issue first. This will allow us to determine whether or not the change should take place. Explain your issue, and we will discuss it with you. If we agree the change is necessary we will mark it as TODO and will fix it when we get a chance, or we will allow a member of the community to supply the change with a pull request.
-   Note that this reference architecture is intended to be a helpful resource aimed at professional security/privacy architects and designers.  
-   Contributions must fit within the scope and goal of this security and privacy reference architecture. Of course we like to discuss your input for changing scope or goals if needed!

Please follow the following procedure when contributing to this document:

-   Fork the chapter you want to change or contribute on GitHub, with the Fork button
-   Clone the repository to your computer
-   Create a branch in which you make your patch git checkout -b &lt;branchname&gt;
-   Make your changes, commit and push the branch
-   -           git add files, git commit
    -           git push origin &lt;branchname&gt;
-       Create a pull request for the branch &lt;branchname&gt; you created (not 'master')

Since we know many security professionals are not familiar with GitHub, we are currently investigating other methods to lower barriers for contributing to this project. 

The maintainers review your pull request and your patch is merged with the master branch ASAP.
