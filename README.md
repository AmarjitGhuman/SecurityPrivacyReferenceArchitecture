# SecurityPrivacyReferenceArchitecture
Open Repository for the Open Security and Privacy Reference Architecture

Open publications for IT security and privacy are still rare. Despite the great work of the OWASP foundation many IT security  organizations are not that open. 

This reference architecture aims to enable you to create better and faster security and privacy solutions by reusing content that is provided in this reference architecture. To encourage collaboration for this project this reference architecture is of course free and open (cc-by-sa).

This project is supported by the BM-Support Foundation, https://www.bm-support.org/ 

Current status: We are working on a complete revision for 2018 of this 'Open Reference Architecture for Security and Privacy'. So join the party and create the 2018 version together with us.


# Contributing

We encourage all security professionals to improve this reference architecture. Join the team to:

* Add security or privacy principles.
* Add security or privacy models.
* Help us create the largest OSS reference framework on OSS security and privacy applications and tools.
* Create better graphics and text.
* Add threat models that can be easily reused.
* Improve criteria on selecting OSS solutions for security and privacy applications.
* Create tools to speed up the process of making use of this reference architecture. E.g. we created a GPL WordPress tool to * manage and create security specification documents fast. Help us to improve these tools or create your own.
