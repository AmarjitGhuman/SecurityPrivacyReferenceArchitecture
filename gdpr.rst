GDPR Building Blocks
=====================

What is the GDPR?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Privacy, security, Internet  and IT systems are complex and form a toxic mix. Many things can and will go wrong. Often it is just a manner of time before real incidents happen. Since detection of privacy and security breaches is also non trivial to accomplish there is a great chance you will never known that your data is seen or copied by unauthorized persons. Privacy is a core value of individuals of democratic societies.

So a valid question is: Will this new GDPR help? Or will companies or governmental organizations still be able to track and trace you? The GDPR official document ( called Directive 95/46/EC) is 261 pages long.  Even for trained security & privacy architects this GDPR document is hard to handle. Mainly due to the fact that layers did a great job to making it opaque what kind of measurements are really needed. Since every organization uses IT nowadays the GDPR is discussed a lot. 

And since security and privacy can never be done correct afterwards you must design or redesign your information systems and take security and privacy as top requirements to reduce risks.
