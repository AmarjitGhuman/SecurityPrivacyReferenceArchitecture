Open Reference Architecture for Security and Privacy
=====================================================

.. image:: /Images/frontimage.jpg

 
This reference architecture is built around information that helps you creating security or privacy solution architectures.
This reference architecture is created to improve security and privacy designs in general. In our opinion it is time to stop reinventing the wheel when it comes down to creating architectures and designs for security and privacy solutions.

The reference architecture is not just another security book. Since libraries and book stores are filled with decent books on security and privacy we wanted to create a book that is all about reuse.
