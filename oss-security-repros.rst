OSS Security Software Repositories
-----------------------------------

The NSA Technology Transfer Program (TTP) works with agency innovators who wish to use this collaborative model for transferring their technology to the commercial marketplace. OSS invites cooperative development of technology, encouraging broad use and adoption.

The collection of NSA repositories is large and some are too good to be neglected. To name a few:

- Apache Accumulo: A sorted, distributed key/value store that provides robust, scalable data storage and retrieval. It adds cell-based access control and a server-side programming mechanism that can modify key/value pairs at various points in the data management process.

- CASA: Identifies unexpected and prohibited Certificate Authority certificates on Windows systems.

- DCP: A program that reduces the timespan needed for making a forensic copy of hard drives for forensic analysis.

- JAVA PATHFINDER MANGO (JPF-MANGO): A static code analysis tool that uses formal methods for analysis. It is part of NASA Ames Java PathFinder project which is a system used to verify executable Java byte code.

- LEMONGRAPH/LEMONGRENADE:Log-based transactional graph database engine backed by a single file. The primary use case is to support streaming seed set expansion, iterative correlation, and recursive file processing.

- Apache NIFI: Automates the flow of data between systems. NiFi implements concepts of Flow-Based Programming and solves common data flow problems faced by enterprises.

- OPENATTESTATION:Verifies system integrity by establishing a baseline measurement of a system’s Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and monitors for changes in that measurement. Originally based on NSA’s Host Integrity at Startup (HIS) software.

- SYSTEM INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT PLATFORM (SIMP):Automates system configuration and compliance of Linux operating systems so they conform to industry best practices.
