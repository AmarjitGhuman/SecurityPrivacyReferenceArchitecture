OSS Privacy Applications
==========================

About this list
-------------------

We know we can never be complete with an overview of OSS privacy applications. Good privacy solution building blocks are not wide spread available. This is due to the fact that the old fashioned business model of tracking users and user activity should never ever be possible. So for communication there is Tor or create your own decentralized device and encrypted protocol. You can find a lot of tools that make it real simple to build a real private communication channel.  

Note:An up-to-date list is always online.

Criteria used for products mentioned in this chapter are equal as for security solutions:

-  The products must have a valid OSS license;

-  The project must be active and must meet a certain quality level;

-  The product must be in use somewhere (\*)

(\*) Unfortunately we can and never will expose information where
products are in use, however many mature products have solid references
on their website, along with active user groups.
