OSS Security Applications
===========================

About this list
-------------------

We know we can never be complete with an overview of OSS security and
privacy applications. The overview in this chapter is created end of
2019-Q1 and is just a guidance to give you:

-  Insights on what type of products are available in the OSS domain.

-  A collection of OSS solution building blocks for your security
   architecture or design you can consider to evaluate for your specific
   use case.

-  Some ideas of solutions you are perhaps not familiar with.

An up-to-date list is always online.

There are now a million different open source software projects
published somewhere on the internet. Our holy grail is to keep track of
the top 50 security and privacy open source projects for every security
and privacy service needed within a business architecture. This way when
you need a secure logging service you can evaluate the top 50 projects
first before searching further or creating (aka forking) your own. In
this first release of this OSS Security and Privacy reference
architecture we yet are far away from this goal.

Criteria used for products mentioned in this chapter are:

-  The products must have a valid OSS license;

-  The project must be active and must meet a certain quality level;

-  The product must be in use somewhere (\*)

(\*) Unfortunately we can and never will expose information where
products are in use, however many mature products have solid references
on their website, along with active user groups.
