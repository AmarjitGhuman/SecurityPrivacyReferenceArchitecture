Open Security Courses
-----------------------

The best courses for learning all about creating good security solutions are open. So cc-by licensed.
Some courses are targeted on IT architects, some are developed for software developers or system administrators. Good training material for training end users on awareness is also available in open format (cc-by-sa). So instead of creating yet another training or course, why not making existing training resources better?
