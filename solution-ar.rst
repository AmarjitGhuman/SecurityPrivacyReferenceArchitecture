Creating a Solution 
=====================

This section outlines a clear and simple way to create your security and privacy solution.

The steps
----------

To create a sustainable solution for security & privacy issues the best start is to create a solution architecture. Since an architecture itself does not protect you but an good solution architecture reduces costs, time and lowers risks. This because in an architecture the emphasis is not only on the IT part and technical solutions but also on embedding solutions into your organisation and processes. 

The perfect solution to reduce security and privacy risks to zero does not exist. An solution architecture helps in the process of optimizing and controlling your risks. 

A good way to really speed up creating your solution architecture is of course to use this reference architecture as basis. This open reference architecture is created to make security & privacy architectures better and help within the process of creation.

Creating security a security or privacy solution architecture consists of the following high level
steps:

-  Dive in the business strategy and organization;
-  Gather security and privacy principles and requirements;
-  Determine important constraints that apply to your architecture or
   design. There are always constraints, e.g. time, budget, subject
   matter experts available etc.
-  Derive the architecture building blocks from your architecture or
   design. Architecture building blocks help you to scope your solution.
   Using architecture building blocks gives a clear view on (new)
   integration aspects and where completely new solutions fit in the
   total IT landscape.
-  Select (or create, buy) the new Solution Building Blocks.
   Prerequisite is of course that the functionality and technical
   constrains must be clear. Often prerequisites are derived from the
   previous design step.


So first create architecture building blocks that will form the basis of your solution. The last stop  to find solution building blocks that will implement your specific problem (ABBs) that match your specific requirements, principles and constrains.
